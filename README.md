A special short prototyping shield for the Arduino, designed to be able
to clear the RJ45 jack on an Ethernet Shield or Freetronics EtherTen.

Note that this design is intended for simple fabrication and assembly,
and does not have many of the features of other prototyping shields
such as the "ProtoShield" (also available from Freetronics) such as
general-purpose LEDs.

Features:

 * Pads for reset button connected to Arduino reset pin.
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you
   are connecting without having to keep turning the board over.
